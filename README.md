Taxi Service

There are roles: Client, ;Administrator.

The customer registers in the system and has the opportunity to place an order for a taxi,
specifying the address of departure, destination, number of passengers and car category.
The taxi service has a fleet of drivers. The car has characteristics for capacity, category and
can be: â€œavailable to order&quot;, &quot;on route&quot; or be inactive (located in the fleet without a driver).
The system calculates the cost of the trip depending on the distance and assigns the
appropriate car among the available ones. If there are no suitable cars - the customer may be
asked to cancel the order or use an alternative solution:
- car with the required number of seats, but a different category;
- several cars of the selected category to provide the required capacity.
  The system supports the loyalty program - a discount is calculated depending on the amount
  spent.
  After the customer confirms the order, the system reports the waiting time.
  The system administrator can view order statistics, sort:
- by the date of order;
- at the cost of the order
  and filter orders:
- by clients;
- by certain dates.
